# Japan Events

**Japan Events** is a fullstack web app for finding events in Japan. It works by by indexing
numerous data sources from around the web and presenting the user with a simple and
intuitive UI for finding said events. End users can search for events by keyword, date(s),
category, budget, location (by prefecture or by proximity in km), or any combination of the
above.

You can try it here: [eventsjp.com](https://eventsjp.com "Japan Events").

## Installation

### Environment Variables

First, you'll need to prepare the following environment varibles.

#### Frontend (`/client`)

- `VITE_API` (this app's server endpoint)

#### Backend (`/server`)

- `PORT` (the Express server port)
- `NODE_ENV` (configures the deployment environment. We recommend `render` if deploying on Render).
- `MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH` for persistent storage on deployment. We recommend `/media`.
- `DB_URL`. The database connection string.
- `API_ALLSPORTDB_KEY`. The API key for connecting to All Sports Database.
- You'll also need to configure your Google Application Credentials. If deploying on Render,
  we recommend keeping this information in a `serviceAccountKey.json` file in the root of the instance.

### Installation Proper

You'll need at least `node.js` version 10.9.0 to run this app.

```bash
cd ./server
npm run build
npm run migrate
npm start
```

## Usage (Frontend)

In addition to the search functions mentioned above, users can login with either a Google
account or with email and password. Authenticated users can save events they're interested
in and access these events in "My Timeline" page. The timeline displays saved events in two
different view modes:

1. _Table View_. Saved events display top-to-bottom in chronological order. Users can
   unpin events.
2. _Week View_. Saved events are displayed in a weekly calendar. Events that take place on
   more than one day are displayed as bars on the top of the view that span more than one day.
   Users can select which days of multi-day events they plan on attending.

Additionally, clicking the Share button provides as link to an anonymized timeline, which
users can share with anyone, including users who are not registered or logged in.

## Usage (Backend)

---

### configuration

for now, configuration is static, and in `util/config.js`.
there, you will find the list of possible datasource, you can enable/disable them with the named attribute (true/false)

#### homeCountry

this is used to add ", {country}" before asking for geocoding. OSM works best if you narrow down the search.

- if the source website cover multiple countries: use "" (blank value) (it's also the default value)
- if not, just add whatever works best for the given country (should be country name in english. ex: japan). (it will be converted to lowercase).

### REST endpoint

#### Initialisation / warmup of cache

first thing to do after application startup, is to populate the cache.
this call must be done for each sourceid (as seen in config.ts) or their content
won't be inside the query result.

launch a resync from the given source id (ex: japanscheapo)

`GET /api/internal/scrap/${sourceid}`

#### Usage

when the cache has been loaded, you can make query against the content.
it will return an unfiltered, merged, list of all event from all enabled source.

`GET /api/events`

also, you can add a query (as for now, only the description field is checked against)

`GET /api/events?query=firework`

#### Location basedsearch

All event will be sent to UI with the "placeDistance" field set with the number of kilometers from:

- the browser location if the UI has set the _browserLat_ & _browserLong_ query field
- O in all other cases (including the one where we are unable to compute the
  distance since the placeFreeform didn't resolve to something in OSM)

on top of that, the resultset of events will be filtered _before_ sent to the UI
and only those where the distance is lower than "placeDistanceRange" will be kept.
As before, if either the browser location OR the event place is not set,
the resulting distance will be O and the event will NOT be filtered out.

To get all fireworks in a 100km radius, with the browser location as xx.xxx/yy.yyy, use:

`GET /api/events?query=firework&placeDistanceRange=100000&browserLat=xx.xxx&browserLong=yy.yyy`

### logging

colorized winston is setup, default send to console
`import { log }Â from ./utils/logger` then `log.info(...)`

### users and timeline endpoints

#### friendship creation

Send a POST request to `/events/friend` with the following body:

{
"user_uid": "user-a",
"friend_uid": "user-b"
}

#### create a timeline entry (=add favorite)

Send a POST request to `/events/timeline` with the following body:

{
"user_uid": "user-a",
"event_id": "uuid"
}

#### get user timeline

send a GET with the userid to `/events/timeline?user_id={userUid}`

### Databroker

every datasource must implements `IEventSource` interface and extends the `DefaultEventsource`
As for now, there is only to exposed methods:

### Scraping

#### to setup up a new data source / website:

note: in all case, please respect the naming convention of the different object type, which are:

- `websiteid` = take the domainname, all lowercase and ascii letter
- `controller name`= websiteid but in camelCase

As a preliminary step, thinks to consider are:

- clone the `server/src/controllers/_templateEventSource.ts` file

##### some cheerio selector:

- "name": selector("h3").first().text(),
- "price": selector(".price>span").text(),
- "priceFull": selector(".product-price-full").text(),
- "description": selector(".product-description").text(),

### backup/restore

all configs are available inside utils/config.js
there is two new values:

backup type = file (for local dev)

```
const config: Config = {
    backupSchedule: "0 22 * * *",
    backupTarget: "file:../backups"
}
```

backup type = sql (for local dev OR production)

```
const config: Config = {
    backupSchedule: "0 22 * * *",
    backupTarget: "sql:backups"
}
```

#### backup

RxDB events collection, wich contains the events metadata, can be exported inside the ${projectDir}/backups folder by calling

`PUT /api/cache/backup/events`

the backup is also run each day at 23 PM

in all case, the backup file ends up in ${projectdir}/backups with a filename containing the current time.

note: all details are sent to node console.

#### restore

a manual restore of this collection can be done by calling

`PUT /api/cache/restore/events`

also, at node startup, the newest backup is took and reloaded inside the engine automatically.

note: all details are sent to node console.

### meta information

there is one endpoint to get the content distribution with different focus.
like how many hits there is in the dataset for a given city, or category

the endpoint is `/api/meta?key=${searchTerm}`

search term can be "category", or "placeFreeform", or any other field that is available in the search endpoint.

the response will looks like

```
[
    {
        "name": "Sports & Fitness",
        "count": 174,
        "label": "Sports & Fitness (174)"
    },
    {
        "name": "Other",
        "count": 331,
        "label": "Other (331)"
    },
    {
        "name": "Performing & Visual Arts",
        "count": 9,
        "label": "Performing & Visual Arts (9)"
    },
    {
        "name": "Food & Drink",
        "count": 13,
        "label": "Food & Drink (13)"
    },
    {
        "name": "Music",
        "count": 13,
        "label": "Music (13)"
    },
    {
        "name": "Film, Media & Entertainment",
        "count": 3,
        "label": "Film, Media & Entertainment (3)"
    }
]
```

### config entries:

#### geocoding

there is three options related to geocoding (address -> lat/long) and reverse geocoding (lat/long -> adress)

for each website config entry:

- `geocodingLookupType: geocodingTypeEnum`
  it has 2 types (see enum) to target a resolution from Open street map or a static map

- `geocodingStaticMap: { "placename": [lat, long], ... }`

look up is done by comparing the placeFreeform name from the original website with the placename. it can start with or ends with.
note: comparaison is done after lowercase() to both placename and placeFreeform.
note: those result are not cached, since they are fast to get
